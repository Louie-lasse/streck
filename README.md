A web-based system for buying stuff and paying later.

### Still to do

* Better UI/CSS. See `restyle` branch.
* Documentation in this README. See `docs` branch.
* Factor out strings somehow? See `babel` branch.
* More obvious visual cue when buying things. Take a detour
  through the product page or display the product image for
  a short while or something like that.
